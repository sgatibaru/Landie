A tenant pays rent via mpesa paybill and uses his contact as an account number, the program
then first searches from the tenants db for such a phone number, if the phone number exists, it
proceeds to accept the payment, and create database with the phone number as a bill reference number.

If a payment is paid by a tenant, then the program updates the tenants rent payment for the month.
The program will have a mind of its own, knowing what to expect for each month that there is in a year
and will constantly calculate the balance and the overpay.

1. Program should understand the times of the year and months
2. Program should understand the payment system
